# SuggestionHelper

SuggestionHelper is a plugin that allows players to send suggestions to the server. Most of the functionality is in how the server admins are able to interact with and manage the suggestions. All file management is done using a third-party service called MLab. This means that no stress is put on the server at all.

The plugin is currently not in working order as it's configured to only run on a single server. Functionality to move between servers will come soon.
